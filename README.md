# WebApp-MBTA
 This is the base repo for MBTA project. Please read [instructions](instructions.md). 

1. project overview: 
this project goes through the mbta to find the nearest mbta station near your location in the boston area where the mbta might be present. we used urllib to get readings and information out of urls and used json data along with APIs to get information out of select websites where input and numerical data was needed. After that we used pprint as a way to test certain function and see their inputs in a more readable way and used various flask functions in order to create the website.

2. project reflection
the process wasn't too long but it was efficient enough to get everything done. Although we planned out to meet at a certain time some of us had more time available then the other due to some other compromises and thus was able to work on it less than their counterpart. 
Although finished in time for the deadline, i believe we should start working on this earlier in the week due to the last few days of the week(saturday and sunday) being relatively busy days in terms of work or sports. Working on this earlier would allow for shared work during times that are explicitly set out for the assignment and the assignment alone.
